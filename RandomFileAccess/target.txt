Can you read backwards? If you want to learn how to read backwards, all it takes is practice and patience. Start by reading smaller words. As you get better, move on to longer words, then entire sentences. You can master it in no time! That is unless you have something better to do with your time, like mastering C++ for example. Come to think of it, the ability to read backwards doesn't really seem to be that useful in the long run. Besides, now you can code a program to read stuff backwards for you. Definitely having programming skill is better than backward reading skill. Keep studying!
